/*
 * A client can have many FlieRequest instances and SearchRequest instances,
 * is a good idea to separate ClientToClient connection into those 2, 
 * this way for the many FileRquest  needed i don't have also to load the
 * SearchRequest... 
 * 
 * Imagine i file whit 1Gb:
 * i'll have like 1 million FileRequest instances
 *
 * if i merge FileRequest + SearchRequest into ClientToClient class 
 * i'll have to load SearchRequest method(part) 1 million times for no reason
