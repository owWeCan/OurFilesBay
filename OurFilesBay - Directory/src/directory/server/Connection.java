/*
 * Directory Server Connection
 * (the same ideas apply to Client Server Connection)
 * 
 * 1. (Thread) queue the connection request -> offer it to pool 
 * 
 * 2. (Thread) execute the connection request queued -> take it from the pool
 * 
 * This way:
 * 
 * - i can handle multiple connection requests at the same time; (controllable how many at the same time)
 * important to control because i can have many request at the same time;
 * 
 * - respond to multiple requests at the same time; (controllable how many at the time)
 * important to control even the simples type because even the simplest type of request may take its time (connection delays, shared resource)
 * 
 * 
 * If want to separate 1. and 2. just need to create another Thread Pool
 *
